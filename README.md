/Bliss - Project 3 Grocer.zip

This particular project is a program based on a grocery application. 
It’s designed to read, display, and analyze grocery item frequency.
It also should allow the user to examine this info and save it to a file. 

I think the program created here is generally modular with its use of class and is organized well. 
It also provides user interaction, and ensures input validation, meaning the user knows whether their entry was viable.

I struggled with and believed improvement could be made in areas such as more comprehensive error handling as well as the use of specific file names. It’s also likely too memory intensive. The file is too large. I tried to revise some things and hit a cap on GitHub 25mb limit.

This project uses Object Oriented Programming, specifically in the form of a class which encapsulates data, and I will no doubt use it many more times. There is also the use of a map which allows for data retrieval based on keys. 

Again, the use of classes aids in its modularity, which will also allow for an easier process of adding additional functions. 
It is made more readable through the use of variable names, comments, and consistency in regard to its formatting.
