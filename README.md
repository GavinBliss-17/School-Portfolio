/Bliss - Project 3 Grocer.zip

This particular project is a program based on a grocery application. 
Its designed to read, display, and analyze grocery item frequency.
It also should allow the user to examin this info, and save it to a file. 

I think the program created here is generally modular with its use of class and is organized well. 
It also provides user interaction, and ensures input validation, meaning the user knows whether their entry was viable.

I sturggled with and believe improvement could be made in areas such as more comprehensive error handling as well as
the use of specific file names. Its also likely too memeory intensive. The file is too large. 

This porject uses Object Oriented Programming, specifically in the form of a class which encapsulates data and I will no doubt
use many more times. There is also the use of a map which allows for dat a retrieval based on keys. 

Again, the use of classes aids in its modularity, which will also allow for an easier process of adding additonal functions. 
It is readable in i
